        <p>Learning to code might seem like the easiest thing to do in the world when you first dabble into it and you are at the begining stage or you see on youtube learn Python from scratch in 1 hour. I have to come to the realisation that if you're coding in your spare time it could take anywhere from six months to two years to get an entry-level tech role. If you treat learning how to code like a full-time job then you can break into the industry in as little as three to eight months.</p>

        <p>Secondly, the time it takes to learn how to code is one thing, another thing is to retain what you have learned. Retaining now takes a different direction which is learning to code by building and not learning to code to craming code blocks and concepts.</p>

        <p>Lastly, learning to code should actually be fun if one follows the right steps. Continue your jouney on this on my <a href="#">page</a> if you wish. I have explained in details the correct steps to take to make learning to code a fun thing and easy. Thank you for reading my article. kindly leave a comment below and let us know how easy and fun you find coding</p>
